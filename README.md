# WeatherPrediction
## Introduction
Weather prediction is a critical application in our daily lives. This project focuses on using historical weather data and machine learning techniques to make accurate weather predictions. By analyzing past weather patterns and data, our goal is to provide valuable insights into future weather conditions.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: We collect historical weather data from reliable sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, formatted, and prepared for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: We employ machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model.
- **Evaluation and Visualization**: Results are evaluated and presented visually for easy interpretation.
